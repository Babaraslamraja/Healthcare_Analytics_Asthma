# 🏥 Clinical Data Analytics: Pediatric Asthma Management
**Author:** [Your Name], PhD (Virology/Immunology), B.Pharm
**Objective:** Career transition project focusing on Health Informatics, Clinical Coding (SNOMED-CT), and Data Analytics.

## 📋 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world clinical data pipeline. Using synthetic EHR data, I identify pediatric asthma patients to analyze treatment adherence and geographical health disparities.

### 🧪 Informatics Standards Used:
* **SNOMED CT:** Used for precise clinical diagnosis identification (Asthma: `195967001`).
* **RxNorm:** Used for medication standardization and classification (Controllers vs. Rescuers).
* **Synthea:** The source for 1,000+ synthetic patient records.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
1. **Data Extraction (SQL):** Querying relational databases to build patient cohorts.
2. **Data Wrangling (R):** Statistical analysis of medication adherence and patient demographics.
3. **Visualization (Tableau):** Creating a population health dashboard for clinical decision support.

## 🌍 Career Vision
Currently pursuing a transition from **Community Pharmacist** to **Health Informatics Specialist**. I aim to leverage my PhD-level research expertise and pharmacy background to improve EHR data standards in the European or Middle Eastern healthcare sectors.
